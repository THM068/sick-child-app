This application is to explore zio http, quill and HTMX.
I will be building a crud application that queries and updates the world database found in the 
world.sql file in the project.

I hope you enjoy this journey of learing zio http and quill.

**Instructions Postgres Database**

1. Download the world.sql file to your computer.
2. Log into postgres via the command line and create a database called world.
4. Run the command \i world.sql. This will create a database and import all
   the database table.
3. Update the application.conf to have your database
